  In March this year my family decided to add a member to our household. Charlie is a six-month old golden retriever.
    Although raising a puppy is not an easy task, Charlie is highly intelligent (when food is present), loyal, and very mischievous.
    A great companion to have alongside you while going through lockdown. </p> <br>
  <h3>INTEREST IN IT</h3>
  <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
  <p>I have been interested in I.T. since I was around 12 years old. I used to control audio and lighting for school theatre shows because
     I preferred being behind a desk, where I wasn't the centre of attention. I was involved in using computers that could manipulate the lighting
     and speakers on stage to drastically change the overall atmosphere of a performance, just as much as the performers themselves. I find it
     fascinating that technology can be the answer to solve many problems and be channelled outlet for creativity and new innovative ideas in our day to day lives. </p>

  <p>My earliest memories of using a computer are video games that got me hooked as a kid. Some that come to mind are Pinball and Solitaire
  on Windows XP and interacting with Clippy, the paperclip Office assistant on Microsoft Word. I still vividly recall the dreaded sound of a
  dial-up connection taking minutes to boot up, and how different browsing the web used to be.</p>

  <p> Aside from some creative applications like Logic Pro, Final Cut, and Adobe Lightroom, my professional experience and understanding in IT
  is quite limited. However, I use technology every day in most aspects of my retail career for communication, point of sale, and inventory
  and stock management. All these functions are leading me to want to further my knowledge more on how both devices and systems operate on a
  technical basis.</p>

  <p>To assist me in building on my knowledge, I have chosen to study at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. My ideal endgame is to
    accomplish a career in this field. With some guidance from my classmates and tutors, I will get a better picture of where I see myself
    progressing onwards to. Allowing me to initiate a spark of confidence when going into the industry. </p>

  <p>Although I consider that my recent work experience has educated me thoroughly towards working within teams, communication skills, and
    customer facing service, I am seeking to learn the approach that should be taken in this industry professionally. Throughout this course,
    I expect to acquire skills that demonstrate how to communicate with clients and colleagues in a sophisticated tone, collaborate with others,
    and reach out to clients in the IT world.</p>
