<h3>IDEAL CAREER</h3>

<h4>FRONT END DEVELOPER</h4>

<p>A front-end developer is responsible for the visual components of a website
  or software application that consumers can interact with. They typically work
   alongside back-end developers who construct the servers that allow the platform
   to operate on the internet. Front-end developers additionally collaborate with
   graphic designers who provide their works of logos, images, video, or anything
   the client would like presented as a visual for customers to see. I find this
   area intriguing as I have always had a creative outlet in life that drives me
   to complete a task, whether that be music or other art forms. With the use of
   current technology, you can bring a design to life that functions as a webpage
   or application online. It is very rewarding that an unlimited amount of people
   across the globe can navigate through a project that your team has spent a great
    amount of time creating.</p>

<p>This particular job listing has requested for experience in front-end development
   and a specific set of skills including:</p>

<h5>Server Environment Manager</h5>
<p>Ensures maintaining all forms of data including hardware, applications, websites,
  cloud and local storage, emails and more. A server environment manager is in charge
  of guaranteeing data is kept up to date, backed up, and stored securely for their client.
   They must uphold servers running at optimal performance for others to rely on doing their
   daily tasks.  </p>

  <h5>API Integration</h5>
  <p>Allows two software components to talk and perform with one another and present shared information.
     An excellent example of this is the integration of a weather app. The application cannot acquire weather
      predictions without sourcing them from a forecast database. API integration connects both the application
      and database to show the same data, users can then quickly glance at the said data on the application installed,
      without having to search up the database online.</p>

  <h5>CMS (Content Management Systems) Develoment</h5>
  <p>A system that individuals can use to construct a webpage without having the knowledge of an experienced developer.
    A CMS is an easily operated interface that can publish posts, customise pages, and handle content while avoiding the
    use of complicated coding or programming skills.</p>

  <p>The advert has asked for approximately two years of experience in web development but hasnâ€™t mentioned a completion
    of a degree. It is common for most front-end developer jobs to expect candidates to have finished university studies
    in Computer Science or Information Technology. I do not have the technical experience required for this role. However,
     over time with guidance from RMIT during the IT course, working alongside fellow students in future projects, and my own
     research and development outside of school, I will be seeking to expand on the relevant skills needed for a similar 
     position.</p>
